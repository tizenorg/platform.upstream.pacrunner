Support for libproxy
====================

The PACrunner package contains an API compatible implementation of the
proxy configuration library.

The origin of libproxy can be found here:

	http://code.google.com/p/libproxy/

With PACrunner daemon the complexity of libproxy is no longer needed and
this small shim implementation should be used instead.
