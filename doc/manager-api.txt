			Valid settings for configuration are these:

			string Method [mandatory]

				The method of proxy configuration. Valid
				values are "direct", "manual" and "auto".

				For "direct" no proxy is used. Using this

				The "auto" configuration requires to have
				the URL setting filled in and be valud.

				fully qualified.

				be valid Javascript with FindProxyForURL()
				function.

				Example:

				function FindProxyForURL(url, host)
				{
					return "DIRECT";
				}

			array{string} Servers [optional]

				List of proxy servers. This value is only
				valid when method is set to "manual".

			array{string} Excludes [optional]

				List of hosts to exclude from proxy lookup.

			string Interface [optional]

				Interface name like "wlan0" etc. to provide
				consistent results for myIpAddress function.

			array{string} Domains [optional]

				Domain names for which the URL is valid.

			array{string} Nameservers [optional]

				List of nameservers for this configuration.

				This value is needed for dnsResolve function

			On successful configuration of this method returns
			an object path that uniquely identifies this specific
			configuration.

		void DestroyProxyConfiguration(object config)

			This method allows to remove a previously configured
			proxy configuration. The object path to use is the
			one returned from CreateProxyConfiguration.

			A proxy configuration is only valid for the lifetime
			of the application creating it. In case it disconnects
			from the bus, the configuration will be automatically
			removed.
