Manual proxy configuration
==========================

PACrunner let's you configure a "manual"  Method  in  the  Manager  DBus  API,
through which  you  can  provide  a  manual  proxy  configuration  filling  in
Servers list and, optionally, Excludes list.
See manager-api.txt for more information.

Such manual configuration handles only well known protocols:
	- http
	- https
	- ftp
	- socks4
	- socks5

It returns only one result, as it is done for the "auto" Method

Format:
------

Servers and Excludes are list of URIs, parsed without any  regular  expression
method in pacrunner's core.   (small  detail:  if  an  IP  address  is	given,
its sanity is not checked)



Servers list follows such URI:
	<protocol://><<login>:<pass>@><hostname><:port></>
Where:
	- protocol: if one of the known protocols, if any
	- login and pass: are the authentication credentials, if any
	- hostname: the hostname or ip address of the proxy server
	- port: the specific port of the proxy service, if any

Excludes rule list follows such URI: <protocol://><rule>
Where:
	- protocol: if one of the known protocols, if any
	- rule: a specific string matching rule on the hostname part

This exclusion rule follows such format:
	- *keyword -> all hostname ending with keyword ('*' is optional)
	- keyword* -> all hostname starting with keyword
	- keyword  -> all hostname containing keyword (*keyword* does the same)

Either the protocol or the rule might not be provided:
	- If the protocol is not provided: the rule will apply	on  all  known
          protocols.
	- If the rule is not provided: the exclusion will be  applied  on  all
          url matching the given protocol.

How Servers list apply:
----------------------

There is 2 ways.  Either there is a generic  proxy  or	protocol  based  proxy
(based on the known protocols). They do not apply together: it's either one or
the other.
So when a proxy server is given without a protocol,  it  will  set  a  generic
proxy server and this will be the only way.

How Excludes list apply:
-----------------------

If a generic exclusion rule is present - a non protocol-based one  then  -  it
will  be  tested  in  priority,  and/or  the  other  rules  will  be   tested.

If given url is for protocol ftp, and there is	no  exclusion  rule  for  that
protocol,  all	other  protocol  rules	will  not   of	 course   be   tested.

Output:
------

"DIRECT", or a server: its hostname and, if present, its port.

DIRECT does not mean it went succefully:
If pacrunner cannot parse the checked URL it will return DIRECT also.
