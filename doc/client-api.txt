================

Service		org.pacrunner
Interface	org.pacrunner.Client
Object path	/org/pacrunner/client

Methods		string FindProxyForURL(string url, string host)

			This method is identical to the FindProxyForURL
			function from the PAC files. If a PAC file is
			available then its FindProxyForURL function will
			be executed and the results reported.

			If no PAC file is loaded, either because no daemon
			is running or because the network doesn't use a proxy
			at all, then the follow default is assumed:

				function FindProxyForURL(url, host)
				{
					return "DIRECT";
				}

			There are no defined errors for this method except
			functional errors in case of memory problems. In all
			other cases it will always return "DIRECT" as proxy
			result.

			The return if "DIRECT" doesn't mean that a working
			Internet connection is present. Validating this is
			not the scope of this interface.

			It is also a good idea to provide a little bit longer
			D-Bus timeout value. The daemon might delay the answer
			due to PAC execution or because a new configuration is
			just being loaded.
